# `helpR` - Random Helper Functions for Coding in R

`helpR` is an R package where the only unifying theme of the functions is honestly just that I wrote them. That said, there are some useful functions for **data wrangling** and **plotting** in particular, though functions for other purposes are also included. I'll add functions to this package as I write more orphan scripts that I hope others might find useful so stay tuned!

## Installation

You can install the development version of helpeR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("njlyon0/helpR")
```

## Summarizing

- **`summary_table`**: Calculates summary values (mean, standard deviation, sample size, and standard error) of a given response variable within supplied groups

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control (QA/QC)

- **`num_chk`**: Checks a column that *should* contain only **numeric** values for any entries that would be coerced to NA if `as.numeric` is run

    - An extension of this function is **`multi_num_chk`** that accepts a vector of columns to check at the same time

- **`date_chk`**: Checks a column that *should* contain only **date** values for any entries that would be coerced to NA if `as.Date` is run

    - An extension of this function is **`multi_date_chk`** that accepts a vector of columns to check at the same time
    
- **`date_format_guess`**: Checks a column containing multiple ambiguous date formats and identifies its best guess for the format each date is in (e.g., 'dd/mm/yyyy' versus 'yyyy/dd/mm', etc.)

- **`diff_chk`**: Compares two vectors and identifies what elements are found in the first but not the second (i.e., *lost* components) and what elements are found in the second but not the first (i.e., *gained* components)

    - This use-case is more oblique but I find it useful when I'm checking which columns are in the data before versus after a significant wrangling step to make sure no columns are lost/gained unexpectedly

## Visualization & Graphics

- **`theme_lyon`**: Applies a set of modifications to the non-data aspects of a `ggplot2` plot to ensure a consistent "feel" of a set of plots

- **`nms_ord`**: Creates a Non-Metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMS) ordination with base R. Requires the disimilarity matrix returned by `vegan::metaMDS`

- **`pcoa_ord`**: Creates a Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) ordination with base R. Requires the distance matrix returned by `ape::pcoa`

## Reshaping Data

- **`array_melt`**: "Flattens" an array of dimensions X, Y, and Z into a dataframe containing columns `x`, `y`, `z`, and `value` where `value` is whatever was stored in the array at those coordinates

## Miscellaneous Other Functions

- **`read_edi`**: Reads in data tables and metadata of a data package hosted by the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) based on the PASTA identifier

    - **`read_edi_meta`** also exists and retrieves only the metadata file for a given PASTA identifier

- **`rmd_export`**: Allows knitting of a specified R Markdown file locally and simultaneously to a specified Google Drive folder. *NOTE:* you must authorize R to work with Google Drive by using `googldrive::drive_auth` for this function to work

## Looking Ahead

More functions are likely to be developed and housed within this package but I find myself using these perennially for quick wrangling checks and exploratory graphing respectively so it seemed worthwhile to pivot these into a true package.

Feel free to post ideas for future functions as [an issue](https://github.com/njlyon0/helpR/issues) on this repository and I'll do my best to build them!
