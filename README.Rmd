# helpR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `helpR` is to to handle some wrangling and plotting edge cases that I found myself repeatedly running into that I couldn't find pre-built R packages to handle. Hopefully they can help you as well!

## Installation

You can install the development version of helpeR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("NJLyon-Projects/helpR")
```
