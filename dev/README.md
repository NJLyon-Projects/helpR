# Development Folder ("dev")

Sometimes I have partially completed functions or functions that don't really fit the current framing of `helpR` that need a place to live. This folder is that place and is not included in the build of the package.

Note, the reason to not use a `dev` branch for this end is that I'm not certain they will ever be included so I don't want to make a branch that falls increasingly far behind the true purpose of the package.
