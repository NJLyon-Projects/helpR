# Development Space

Sometimes I have partially completed functions or functions that don't really fit the current framing of `supportR` that still need a place to call home. This folder is that place and is not included in the build of the package.

Note, the reason to not use a `dev` branch for this end is that I'm not certain they will ever be included so I don't want to make a branch that falls increasingly far behind the living version of `supportR`.
